== Current Status
This script only currently supports linux distros that use the APT package manager. (Debian, Ubuntu & friends)

This application is incomplete in features but safe to use and still helpful.
Keep watching my github... I am making regular improvements. Any upgrades version will remain compatible.

Major current limitations: 
  script does not manage gems nor remove .deb or gem packages from the lists
Minor limitations:
  see the TODO file for unimplemented options
