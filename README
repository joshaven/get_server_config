== Current Status
This script only currently supports linux distros that use the APT package manager. (Debian, Ubuntu & friends)

This application is incomplete in features but safe to use and still helpful.
Keep watching my github... I am making regular improvements. Any updates will remain compatible with all versions.

Major current limitations: 
  script does not manage gems nor remove .deb or gem packages from the lists
Minor limitations:
  see the TODO file for unimplemented options


== Overview
I am purposing kept the requirements to a minimum yet provide a simple way to track & maintain package and 
configurations. This script will help you keep track of installation procedures and soon will have a partner 
script that will help track all configuration file changes.  The end will be the ability rebuild a server 
automatically from the logs created by these scripts.  Data backup is not a complicated thing but server 
configuration backup, in my experience is generally lacking.  My goal it to make server configuration just
another 'data' to backup.  So if the server goes down, setup a fresh copy of the distro, copy the data to the
new server and ask the server to: 'get --rebuild'.  Is it too much to ask for?  I don't think so.


== Quick Start
Execute script with installer option
  sudo bash ./get_installer.sh --self_install #see INSTALL for details
Read the included help info
  sudo get --help
Example installation
  `sudo get ruby`
Explanation of what this script does:
  1) Appends /etc/get_server_config/deb.list with 'ruby'
  2) Installs 'ruby' from your servers apt repo
