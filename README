== Current Status
This script only currently supports linux distros that use the APT package manager: ie debian, ubuntu & friends

This application is incomplete!  The script does not manage gems nor remove .deb or gem packages from the lists
This script is fully functional for adding .deb packages.

sample useage (working feature):    `sudo get ruby`
The above adds ruby to the /etc/get_server_config/deb.list file and installs using your configure apt servers
