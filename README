== Current Status
This script only currently supports linux distros that use the APT package manager. (Debian, Ubuntu & friends)

This application is incomplete in features but safe to use.  Keep watching my github... I am making regular improvements.
Major current limitations: 
  script does not manage gems nor remove .deb or gem packages from the lists
Minor limitations
  see the TODO file


== Overview
This script is meant to function at a very low level.  I am purposing kept the requirements a minimum yet provide a consistent
way to track & maintain package.


== Quick Start
To install get download the script and they type `sudo bash ./get_installer.sh --self_install` see INSTALL for details
For help on using 'get' please type 'get --help' at the command prompt.
As an example, to add the ruby package to your system you would issue this command:
`sudo get ruby`
Which would add 'ruby' to the /etc/get_server_config/deb.list file and install ruby from your servers apt repo


== Dependancies
* bash
* sudo
* dpkg
* apt
