Its as easy to install as downloading the installer script and running it:
wget http://github.com/joshaven/get_server_config/raw/master/get_installer.sh
sh ./get_installer.sh


If you appreciate the work I put into this please paypal me (yourtech@gmail.com) a buck or two...

This command will create the directory structure required and symlink the 'get' script into /usr/local/bin
It will also confirm that 'get' is in your path

Read the README for an explanation of this script or be lazy and just run 'get --help'

No other files are needed for the operation of 'get'
