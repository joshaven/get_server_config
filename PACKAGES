This file is my notes about building debian packages.  Please use the installation manager, 'get', to
install packages once you have built them and copied them to /etc/get_server_config/deb/

Some options for building .deb packages are: 
- checkinstall http://lmgtfy.com/?q=checkinstall
- dh-make http://lmgtfy.com/?q=dh_make
