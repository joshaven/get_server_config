Ideas:
  New app: "modify" > config file tracker.
  From the console type `modify /etc/postfix/postfix.conf` to backup and edit using the system configured editor.
  Backs up changes using tar.gz repo or git repo
  An alternative would be something that automatically watches configs
  
Feature:
  `get --initialize` > to add all currently installed packages to 'tracked' apps.  This is to make your server more portable...
  `get search`... probably turn returns into a numbered list showing results '1'-1'0' and 'n' for next page.
  
Maintenance:
  ensure script is modular enough that it is easy to support other options namely: yum, python:easy_install, python:pip
