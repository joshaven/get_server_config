Improvements:
  - Move to storage of packages to some type of abstracted storage system 
    (through abstraction function & better file schema) instead of multiple files.
  - Add migration of data when running --self_install
  - `get --initialize` > to add all currently installed packages to 'tracked' apps.  This is to make your server more portable...
  - Add tagging to installs (to track purpose etc) (ie: mail, rails, etc,)
    - default tag as prior tag (in case multiple apps are installed under the same project... like 'mail')
  - Add date/times to installed apps
  - Force installs to be run as a non-root user & use sudo internally when needed except when sudo is not available on the system
  - Support other package managers namely: yum, python:easy_install, python:pip
  - Support search (ie: `get search ruby`)
    - Interactive options:
      1) ruby - An interpreter of object-oriented scripting language Ruby
      2) ruby-dev - Header files for compiling extension modules for Ruby
      3) ruby-elisp - Emacs-lisp ruby-mode for Ruby
      4) ruby-full - Ruby full installation
      ... through 0
      (C)anccel - (P)revious page - (N)ext page
  - Add --list to list the content of the tracked packages grouped by installation type and possibly by tags
      
Ideas:
  New app: "modify" or "mod" > config file tracker.
  From the console type `mod /etc/postfix/postfix.conf` to backup and edit using the system configured editor.
  Backs up changes using tgz, git, or other repo
  An alternative would be something that automatically watches configs which would be cooler but probably more intrusive
