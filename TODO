Improvements:
  - Move to storage of packages to some type of abstracted storage system 
    (through abstraction function & better file schema) instead of multiple files.
  - Add migration of data when running --self_install
  - `get --initialize` > to add all currently installed packages to 'tracked' apps.  This is to make your server more portable...
  - Add commenting to installs (to track purpose etc)
    - support default comment as prior comment (in case multiple apps are installed under the same project... like 'setup mail')
  - Add date/times to installed apps
  - Add user for install
  - Force installs to be ran by a non-root user & use sudo internally when needed except when sudo is not available on the system
  - Support other options namely: yum, python:easy_install, python:pip
  - Support search (ie: `get search ruby`)
    - Interactive options:
      1) ruby - An interpreter of object-oriented scripting language Ruby
      2) ruby-dev - Header files for compiling extension modules for Ruby
      3) ruby-elisp - Emacs-lisp ruby-mode for Ruby
      4) ruby-full - Ruby full installation

Ideas:
  New app: "modify" or "mod" > config file tracker.
  From the console type `modify /etc/postfix/postfix.conf` to backup and edit using the system configured editor.
  Backs up changes using tar.gz repo or git repo
  An alternative would be something that automatically watches configs
